## Python script to get the content of my public toots on my mastodon instance, via rss  and then cross post them to my microblog for long term archival
The script will gets RSS entries from a mastodon account feed and create text files in the current directory, which you can then give to Hugo to process

 ### Caveats
The script also does no verification of any sort. for e.g.,  to see, if the feed is malformed.  
Use at your own risk

## Install
1. In a virtualenv, install requirements with `pip`  
I use Python 3.11

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the script to pull toots and push to the microblog *(this is wip)*
```bash
python mastodon_to_moi.py <'mastodon rss feed url (without the angle brackets â€¦ or teh quotes)'>
```
or alternatively
2. Change `fallback_url` in `settings.py` to your feed url to run without specifying the url
